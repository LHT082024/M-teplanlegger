me attempting to make an api where you can plan meetings. User will be able to. 
create a meeting where they can put it time, place, and subject matter. 
store this meeting in a database and with the use of Id find pre made meetings and check them. 
create "user profiles" and store them in their databse that keep tracks of age, job title and name. 
add these user profiles to meetings so they can easily get a complete list of people who attend their meetings
